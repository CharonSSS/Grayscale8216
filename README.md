# Grayscale8216
Machine learning raising 8-bit grayscale heightmap up to 16-bit, without terraces and precision loses compared to the original 8-bit heightmap. Written by AI and [Aebestach](https://github.com/Aebestach).

## Demonstration and Comparison:

### From top to bottom are (Example of Mimas, which has original 16-bit)
* 8-bit heightmap derived from original 16-bit
* 16-bit heightmap converted from the 8-bit above using machine learing
* original 16-bit

### From top to bottom are (Example of Io, which doesn't have original 16-bit)
* original 8-bit heightmap
* 16-bit heightmap converted from the 8-bit above using machine learing
